02. Qulitative and Quantive Data, what are we doing now what can we do in the future
03. How are we gathering analytics on the quality fo the program
04. ONly 30% or orgs can link training to performance
05. Adaptive learning Paths
06. Could be used to track and remond apren to do lessons.

01. Quntatative/Qulatitive
	Qualtitive:
		How did this make you feel?
		Demographics
		How to collect data:
			A/B Testing
			Survey
				Need to be thoughtful
			User Testing
				Need to observe 

	Quantitive: The numbers, hard data
		Dont mean shit with out context
		There need to be clear goals

	Analytics
		Who are the 'customers'
			Stakeholders
			Apprentics
			Ourselves

		This about internal and external forces working aganst the project

		Observeale, Mesurabel, actionable

		This is not about how many people pass the course, its about wether or not we made a difference in the quality of the talent pool

	DATA IN THE REAL WORLD
		nss.gov/dataquality.aboutqualityframwork.jsp
		Our brains are our own worst enemies
		Create Hypos and look for both this that confirm and things that go aganst
		Dashoboards can be dangerous

# SMEs CAN WE TALK
	
	What is the difference between TRAINING and EDUCATION?

	## PROJECT KICKOFF
		Meeting Agenda:
			Set up how people communicate/methods
			Set the process and their expetations/concenquesces
				Find out a secondary person that can provide content if needed
			Who needs to be there:
				department heads
				people with longegitivy
				people that are experincing the heartburn from the problem

		Map the process:
			Find out how people want to be communicated with and how offten
			Figure out when a web meeting is fine and when people need to be face to face
			What dates, deadlines and event do I need to know about?

		Setting Expectation
			When asking for feedback be very speciffic about what input you are looking for and remember that they are still importaint.

## Making You Instruction Learnable - Patti Shank

	Look up Replicability

	Use research proven tactics
	Teaching people the way they like to learn does not work (look at research)
	Memory is a larg constraint in what people can learn.
	Working Memory shoul dbe the focus of of all teaching
	Learning is a combination of working memory and pulling things out of long tearm memory
		You cannot shove info at people (craming 12 lessons in at the end of a semester).
	Revisiting the learning is critical, you will lose most info that is not that is not repeatedly revisited
		Figure out what we are doing to overwhelm memory
	CONEPTS:
		Readability - 
			You need a readability score of 60-70
			If you make people slow down to read, they simply stop.
		Usablility - How easy an object is to use

	Learning Objects should al ways be provided
	What can we do to help people to remember - 
		You must chunk out learning esp on the web
	Practics under the same context as use
	Senerieons do not need to look like the job, they need to feel like the job. Unless highly technichal
	Adaptive learning should be split into novices and experts, not along learning styles
	Self-Check (look in to it)

## Dirty Little Secretes in eLearning

	LEarning objectives are for designers but if you are putting them in to a sotry type

## Wearables

	Its a way to get data from the real world.
